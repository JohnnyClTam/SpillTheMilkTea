Bethany, Jade and Johnny share their unwritten rules while travelling and challenge what's acceptable. Join us for the pilot episode <i>(pun intended)</i> as we share airplane stories and learn crazy habits we each do while travelling.

<i>Can you get drunk on a plane? Who gets the armrest? How many times can you get up & go to the washroom? Can you use your skincare routine? Can you eat while everyone's sleeping? </i>
